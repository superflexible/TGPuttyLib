TGPuttyLib Release History
---------------------

Build 30 - 10 Feb 2026

TGPuttyLib has now been updated to PuTTY 0.83. It continues to be an important project for me 
and many customers despite the rare updates. I will attempt to merge the next PuTTY release much faster.

---------------------
Build 25 - 03 Jan 2024

TGPuttyLib has been updated to PuTTY 0.80. Build 25 also includes some additional improvements.

---------------------

Build 19 - 06 Mar 2022

This release is based on PuTTY 0.76 and contains a few bug fixes related to buffering and progress 
reporting. SSH server fingerprints are now reported in both MD5 and SHA formats to the host key 
verification callback function.

---------------------

Build 13 - 24 Mar 2021

Fixes occasional/rare crashes due to an uninitialized local variable, adds a download function 
written in Pascal and a checkpoint mechanism for debugging.

---------------------

Build 11 - 14 Jul 2020

Adds the Linux shared library libtgputty.so and adjusts tgputtylib.pas and the FPC Simple Demo 
to work with FPC on Linux.

---------------------

Build 10 - 4 Jul 2020
Updated to PuTTY 0.74

---------------------

Build 9 - 13 May 2020
Fix for Windows XP and Server 2003, 32 bit: not depending on GetTickCount64

---------------------
Build 8.1 - 23 Mar 2020
Contains a small PBoolean related fix.

---------------------
Build 8 - 23 Mar 2020

Adds Proxy Support and includes various bug fixes.

---------------------
Build 7 - 23 Dec 2019

Uses #ifdefs to remove the memory allocation callback features, which are only used for debugging.
This reinstates binary compatibility with older builds.

---------------------
Build 6 - 23 Dec 2019

This update fixes more memory leaks and rare AVs. It also adds the optional memory checking code
used to detect any leaks. This code is not active by default and removed by the linker.

---------------------
Build 5 - 21 Dec 2019

This update fixes memory and event handle leaks. The event handle leak in winsftp.c is actually
still in the original PuTTY 0.73. I will try to submit the fix to them. The memory leaks were
in DLL exclusive code (well except for one that doesn't affect us anyway).

---------------------
Build 4 - 3 Dec 2019

This update fixes incorrect random permissions on uploaded files, which could happen when 
files were uploaded from a Delphi stream (like the Delphi component does it, even if you 
use the UploadFile method with a file path). 
The bug itself was in the DLL.

Also includes minor improvements in some of the Pascal source code files.

---------------------
Build 3 - 1 Dec 2019

Added C++ Support, including binding and classes for C++ Builder and Visual C++, as well as 
a native C++ Builder SFTP Client component that does not use any Delphi code. 

No import library is needed for C++.

---------------------

Build 2 - 1 Nov 2019

Adds true Delphi Component in tgputtysftpclient.pas, which is fully Unicode. Assumes UTF-8 Encoding is used.
Adds VCL demo based on the new component.
Fixes procedure tgputty_setverbose declaration.
Fixes some UTF-8 problems in messages from the DLL.
Minor Demo improvements, including Unicode support for local filenames when downloading.

---------------------

Build 1 - 20 Oct 2019

Initial Release. Stable but more features will be added
Known Issue: procedure tgputty_setverbose does not work due to missing cdecl;

---------------------
